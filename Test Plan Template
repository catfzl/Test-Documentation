##  4.4 Test Approach:
Our testing approach will be structured around the following methodologies:

* Agile Testing: Regular testing iterations aligned with development sprints.
* Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Testing: Writing tests that describe behavior from a user perspective (in Gherkin).
* Risk-Based Testing: Prioritizing testing activities based on identified risks.
* Exploratory Testing: Simulating real-world user interactions to uncover potential issues.

Once development begins, the development team will create and run unit tests against all code developed. 

The QA team will be able to see all unit test results from development. Once multiple modules or components have been completed the test team will begin [System Integration Testing(SIT)](#1213-system-integration-testing-sit).  This will continue until all modules/components have been deemed as “Code Complete”. 

The QA team will begin User Acceptance Testing (UAT) where positive tests, created by the QA team, will be performed to verify the acceptance criteria have been met. 

Any issue discovered while testing will be reported in JIRA by means of bug creation, and linked to the appropriate Epic,  &lt;projectNameJiraEpic>, where they will then be managed until they are closed. Discovered defects will be part of regression test iterations until no Severity Level 1 or 2 issues remain.

# 7 Test Deliverables
Test Deliverables will be provided at various stages throughout the testing process and upon completion of testing activities.

## 7.1 Test Plan Document:
This will be provided at the beginning of the testing process, outlining the overall testing approach, objectives, scope, schedule, and other essential information.

## 7.2 Test Cases:
Provided before test execution begins and will serve as a guide for testing activities. This should be comprehensive, covering multiple scenarios to ensure thorough testing.

## 7.3 Test Reports:
Test Reports and results shall be shared continuously during the test execution phase. It will show test coverage, testing progress, pass/fail status- or other applicable status in TestRail- and defects found. Reports will be shared in each story, bug etc. in JIRA to keep shareholders informed.

## 7.4 Defect Reports:
Defects will be provided in test reports, utilizing TestRail Run results, and mentioned in each ticket comment for additional visibility. Should a defect require bug creation, it will include detailed information including severity, steps to reproduce, and any other relevant details; the issue will be linked to the ticket being tested when discovered. While in development, bugs will be attached to the General Bugs epic, this will be monitored to ensure they can be prioritized and addressed appropriately. Bugs discovered after the successful release to production will be filed against the &lt;projectNameJiraEpic> epic.

## 7.5 Final Test Summary Report:
Upon completion of all testing activities, a final test summary report will be provided to summarize the overall testing process; including test coverage, testing results, key findings, lessons learned, and recommendations for future improvements. It will provide stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of the testing efforts and outcomes.
*This will also serve as a means to provide insight into future test plans and refinement needs.

# 8 Risk Management

## 8.1 Assumptions

#### 8.1.1 Integration with Existing Systems
* Assumption: &lt;projectName> will integrate smoothly with our existing authentication systems and user management frameworks.
* Rationale: Integrating with the existing system will allow smoother implementation, without disrupting the user’s experience or established workflow.

#### 8.1.2 Risk Reduction
* Assumption:  &lt;projectName> will mitigate risk of &lt;risk> for &lt;user>.
* Rationale: The goal of &lt;projectName> is to improve security by &lt;context> for customers. 

#### 8.1.3 Scalability
* Assumption: &lt;projectName> infrastructure can scale to accommodate increased event consumption
* Rationale: As users become &lt;context>, it must be able to scale to maintain performance and reliability.

#### 8.1.4 User Notification and Education
* Assumption: &lt;stakeholders> will have clear and comprehensive communication about the &lt;projectName> process.
* Rationale: Effective messaging and education enable user understanding and Care’s ability to support any questions related to users &lt;projectNameActions>.

#### 8.1.5 Continuous Monitoring and Improvement
* Assumption: Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of &lt;projectName> implementation will identify areas for improvement and refinement.
* Rationale: By monitoring performance we will be better able to identify and address issues early, optimize performance, improve user experience, and gain valuable insights to position us for long-term success.

## 8.2 Risks
* Risk: Increased support load due to &lt;projectName> implementation. 
    * Mitigation: Collaborate with communication teams for effective user troubleshooting guides to help Care agents familiarize themselves with the &lt;projectName> process and address any technical or usability issues they may encounter.
    * Mitigation: Provide clear documentation to &lt;endUser> for visibility to stay up-to-date with any new automatic archival of Inactive users.

* Risk: User resistance following implementation surrounding the &lt;pointOfFriction>. Possible resistance could include disruption of workflow and added complexity.
    * Mitigation: User education, communication/messaging; providing clear comms via email and workflow UI to cover the necessity and benefits, and guidance on implementation.
    * Mitigation: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather user input and address concerns promptly, demonstrating responsiveness to user needs.

* Risk: Late addition of new requirements could impact the deadline for completion, leading to an increased risk of defects being deployed to production.

Evaluate how well the system performs under different workload conditions. This includes tests such as:

###### ***Load Testing:*** 
*Assessing the system's performance under normal and peak load conditions.

###### ***Stress Testing:***
Pushing the system beyond its normal operational limits to identify breaking points or performance bottlenecks.

###### ***Scalability Testing:***
Testing the system's ability to handle increasing loads by adding resources.

###### ***Endurance Testing:***
Checking the system's ability to sustain continuous operation over a prolonged period.

##### **12.1.2.1** **Security Testing: **
Ensures that the system is secure and protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. This includes tests such as:

###### ***Vulnerability Assessment:***
Identifying potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system.

###### ***Penetration Testing:***
Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and assess the system's resilience.

###### ***Authentication Testing:***
Verifying the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms and access controls.

###### ***Authorization Testing:***
Checking whether users have appropriate permissions and access rights.

##### **12.1.2.3 Usability Testing: **
Assesses the user-friendliness and ease of use of the system from the end-user's perspective. This includes tests such as:

###### ***User Interface (UI) Testing:*** 
Evaluating the layout, design, and usability of the user interface.

###### ***Accessibility Testing:***
Ensuring that the system is accessible to users with disabilities and complies with accessibility standards.

###### ***User Experience (UX) Testing:*** 
Gathering feedback from users to assess their overall satisfaction and experience with the system.

##### **12.1.2.4 Compatibility Testing: **
Checks the compatibility of the system with different hardware, operating systems, browsers, and other software components. This includes tests such as:

###### ***Browser Compatibility Testing:***
Ensuring that the system functions correctly across different web browsers.

###### ***Device Compatibility Testing:*** 
Testing the system on various devices (e.g., desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones) to ensure compatibility.

#### **12.1.3 System Integration Testing (SIT):**
A level of testing performed by the QA team where individual components or modules are combined and tested as a group to verify that they work together as expected within the larger system or application.

#### **12.1.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT): **
Formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether or not a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable the user, customers, or other authorized entity to determine whether or not to accept the system.
